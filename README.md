# StockSimulation
I took a class called Financial Mathematics (MST Math 5737) and this project will be taking lessons learned to practice my Data Science skills. This will involve trying to simulate stock prices and their flucations, simulate various portfolios (stocks, options, etc), and some AI training. Another goal will be finding potential applications to games for teaching students about our financial markets.

## Questions Asking
 - Can we use Generalized Wiener Process to generate realistic stock data?
 - Can we use Ito's Lemma to generate realistic stock data?
 - How does changing the G(S) function in Ito's Lemma affect the stock simulation?
 - How does changing the G(S) function used in Black–Scholes–Merton model?
 - Can we use simulated data to train AI to predict the mean and volitility of stock prices?
 - Can we parallelize market simulation to speed up simulation times?
 - How do various portfolios compare to each other and can we find a formula to find the desirable portfolios (maximizing profit and minimizing risk)?
